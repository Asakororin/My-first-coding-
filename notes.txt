## Installing Libraries:
If you get an error that looks like this:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'badlib'

you will need to install the missing library using 'pip'

the syntax is:

$ py -m pip install badlib
